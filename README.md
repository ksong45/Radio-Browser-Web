# Radio Browser Web

> An interactive web app for discovering nearby radio stations by location and genre.

Radio Browser Web is a lightweight, end-to-end system that helps users explore local radio stations anywhere in the world.  
It combines geolocation, map-based visualization, and real-time filtering to make radio discovery intuitive and visual.
